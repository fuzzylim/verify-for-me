# Scam Awareness

## Why

This project aims to raise awareness of scams and how you can act to protect yourself. The key messages we want to share
are:

- 1 real companies will not pressure you to make a transaction
- 2 you need to check the caller but
- 3 the ways to do this are not so obvious ...

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and
load Inter, a custom Google Font.
